                    Tuan Dang will begin his role as an assistant professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Arkansas in Fall 2025. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington, USA, in 2025, under the supervision of  <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?user=huber">Dr. Manfred Huber</a>. Prior to that, he obtained a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Science from Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea in 2013. During that time, he worked as a project manager, developing real-time robot controllers using EtherCAT technology for various industrial robots, which have been adopted by numerous manufacturers. His research interests focus on robot learning, particularly the representation of real-time observations, bio-inspired navigation, and manipulation.
